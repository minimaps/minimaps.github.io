Please read this Agreement carefully before accessing or using our Services. By accessing or using any part of our Services, you agree to become bound by the Terms of this Agreement.

Our Services are not directed to children younger than 13, and access and use of our Services is only offered to users 13 years of age or older. If you are under 13 years old, please do not register to use our Services. Any person who registers as a user or provides their personal information to our Services agrees that they are 13 years of age or older.

Use of our Services requires a Minimaps account. You agree to provide us with complete and accurate information when you register for an account. You will be solely responsible and liable for any activity that occurs under your email. You are responsible for keeping your password secure.

Your Minimaps Account and Maps. If you create an account on Minimaps, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and map, and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account and any other actions taken in connection with the map. You must immediately notify Minimaps of any unauthorized uses of your map, your account, or any other breaches of security. Minimaps will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.

<p>
<b>Responsibility of Contributors.</b> If you operate an account, create a map, comment on a map, post content to Minimaps, post links on Minimaps, or otherwise make (or allow any third party to make) material available (any such material, “Content”), you are entirely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from, that Content or your conduct. That is the case regardless of what form the Content takes, which includes, but is not limited to text, photo, video, audio, or code. By using Minimap, you represent and warrant that your Content and conduct do not violate these Terms. By submitting Content to our Service for inclusion on your map, you grant Minimaps a world-wide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, modify, adapt and publish the Content solely for the purpose of displaying, distributing, and promoting your map. If you delete Content, Minimaps will use reasonable efforts to remove it from Minimaps, but you acknowledge that caching or references to the Content may not be made immediately unavailable. Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, Minimaps has the right (though not the obligation) to, in Minimap's sole discretion, (i) reclaim your map's URL due to prolonged inactivity, (ii) refuse or remove any content that, in Minimap's reasonable opinion, violates any Minimaps policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable, or (iii) terminate or deny access to and use of Minimaps to any individual or entity for any reason. Minimaps will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid.

Minimaps will terminate a visitor’s access to and use of the website if, under appropriate circumstances, the visitor is determined to be a repeat infringer of the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of Minimaps or others.
